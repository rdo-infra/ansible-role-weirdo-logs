- name: Including the weirdo-logs role directly
  vars:
    msg: |
         It is not possible to include the weirdo-logs role directly.
         It is meant to be used like so:

             - include_role:
                 name: "weirdo-logs"
                 tasks_from: "bootstrap.yml"
             # or
             - include_role:
                 name: "weirdo-logs"
                 tasks_from: "recover.yml"
  fail:
    msg: "{{ msg.split('\n') }}"
